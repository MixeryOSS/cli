# Mixery CLI tool
_Command-line tool for advanced users_

## Do you need CLI?
If you just want to _try_ Mixery: No.

If you want to run Mixery with addons: Also no. Mixery in your browser can load addons from given URL, ~~Tarball or Zip file~~ (these will be implemented at later date). Simply drag and drop those files to your DAW and the addon will be installed and loaded.

If you want to configure Mixery, make addons or you think CLI is cool then this CLI tool is for you.
